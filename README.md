### Project Title

U.S. States Game

### Project Description

This is a simple Python project that combines graphic programming with data manipulation to create an interactive educational game. The game uses the `turtle` library to display a blank map of the United States and prompts the user to enter the names of states. As states are correctly identified, their names are displayed on the map. The game continues until all 50 states are named or the user decides to exit.

### Features

- **Graphic Interface**: Displays a blank map of the United States and captures mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
- **Data Input**: Uses a text input box to receive state names from users.
- **Validation**: Checks if the entered state name is valid and whether it has already been guessed.
- **Output**: When the user types "Exit", the game generates a CSV file of the states that were not guessed, allowing the user to learn them later.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used to develop the game.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library used to manage the list of states and coordinates.
- **Turtle**: Graphics library used to render the map and manage graphical interactions.


### Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome, especially in improving the graphical interface or adding new features, such as scoring or hints for users.
